This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a university course repository for **CPEN 422 - Software Testing and Analysis** at UBC. The repository contains course materials for a graduate-level software testing course taught by Professor Ali Mesbah.

## Repository Structure

- `syllabus/` - Contains the course syllabus in LaTeX format

## Course Context

This repository supports a software testing and analysis course covering:

- Static and dynamic analysis techniques
- Unit, integration, and system testing
- Regression testing strategies
- Test adequacy criteria and code coverage
- Mutation testing and fault-based analysis
- Program analysis (symbolic execution, control-flow, data-flow)
- Domain-specific testing (web apps, mobile apps, GUIs)
- Test generation and AI-assisted testing
- Automated testing tools and frameworks

## Development Guidelines

### Course Materials
- The primary course document is the LaTeX syllabus in `syllabus/syllabus-cpen422-2025.tex`
- To compile LaTeX documents, use standard LaTeX compilation commands
- Course uses Canvas for content delivery and Piazza for discussion

### Academic Integrity
When working on course-related materials:
- AI tool usage is permitted but must be fully attributed with clear disclosure
- All AI-generated content must include explicit comments indicating the nature of AI contribution
- Students must understand and be able to explain any submitted code
- Collaborative work is done in pairs for lab assignments

### Key Course Information

## Notes for Claude Code Usage

When assisting with this repository:
- Respect academic integrity policies - do not complete assignments for students
- Focus on educational guidance rather than direct solutions
- Consider the pedagogical context when providing assistance
- Maintain awareness of the course's emphasis on testing and analysis methodologies
